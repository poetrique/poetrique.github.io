## At an end

fight the void  
or fight the noise  
either way, it is your choice

the darkness  
is the light  
the bright star  
shines not at night

ask why  
of yourself, and I  
will appear and  
teach you of  
ancient philosophies

pause here,  
make no love to hypocrisies

---

## Lucid

clear are my thoughts  
after wars won, and love lost  
succeed we must  
as long as air kisses the dust

my art will grow  
joy you will know  
for we are the light  
of an ancient sun

strong we shall be  
this be our destiny

---

## Hook

do not believe I  
know not what I  
desire, seek, require, believe

just because  
sometimes I fall shy  
of your simple imaginations

---

## Reality

we dance away from  
stronger roots, than  
branches stretched from  
the mind's roof.

for sake of pain, for  
same again, and stumble  
sharp, with crooked hooves.  
when we could stand

indeed we do, we wake up strong  
from dreams untrue.  
with hope quite calm  
and vigor renewed,

to do the things  
we feared to do.

## The Journey

The Journey
Once upon a time  
A little while ago  
My younger self  
Hopped on a jet  
To learn to scale technology.

I left the land  
I knew as home  
All for faith,  
To grow some more  
To rise & soar.

The journey has begun  
For a life of Entrepreneurship  
Never truly ends.  
Blessed with momentum infinite  
I have newfound family.

## Alone

look at the title  
I am not so  
speak and breathe with apostles  
dance around thoughts colossal

I am a child of God so  
I fall, I weep, I think  
to live, is not to be good or bad, so  
I learn my ways  
each passing day

---

## Seasons

man has been falling  
ever since before  
his tongue, learned to turn  
and kiss flame  
learned to burn

you should follow no format  
be free, and come close  
live with your soul above the sky  
let the dust know naught of your toes  
man has been rising

---

## Initialize

you know what to do  
the boxes are made  
tick, check  
draw the line across

you know what to do  
at this time  
the light of the moon  
should cut you no more

---

## Beginnings

even as I waver  
I know some things to be true  
the rising of the sun, after night  
and the face of the ocean, blue

## A Poem At Dusk

at seventeen  
all I wanted to do was dream  
and I did, till I fell asleep  
when I woke  
I feared to breathe, to blink  
and then I slept once more  
and in a dream I witnessed  
a vague relevation  
this, triggered a hunt  
for what I knew not  
a hunger did whirl  
in my youthful soul

a week to nineteen  
I met with reality  
she sang me a song  
of digital vitality.  
one of wonder, one of strength  
and I learnt to sculpt the shadows of the web  
I learnt to give form, to thoughts  
a blessed gift, indeed that is  
for one who was at then  
as truly lost as I was

fast forwardâ€¦ twenty-one  
in a land of warmth, serene  
I know now  
even though the road, was in itself  
nothing odd, the destination is yet still  
so intense that all can do is tutor my mind  
walk in awe and nod  
as the path grows ever narrow  
and I grow ever thirsty  
for the precious drops of nectar  
that wisdom offers her travellers

to dream should never seem  
truly like anything, too foolish to pursue  
too stressful to endure  
if I have learnt nothing  
I have learnt to trust  
in the motions of universal winds  
for all things  
come to those who work  
even more so, than those who walk  
for in the path itself, is nothing but a way  
in the light of night  
may I still trek the same

## Monday in Lagos

I woke up to religion  
I went to work  
with strong precision  
To move ahead, yet still

The peaceful get nothing  
in the temple of the Lagoon  
My mother's people  
The meek and the mild  
They hustle to fill their spoon

## Letters from Accra

> A short collection of poems written during the Chale Wote festivities in Accra (Ghana), 2019

#### Origins

I do not know where  
I truly do come from  
my soul does  
beat, and hiss, and hum

my heart  
proves a crooked drum  
I seek no validation

nor look to beg, "please"  
my nation is a country  
that knows not that it is

#### Anything

rainbows from the sun  
love that's always born  
a sacred need  
true wonder indeed

anything  
can make you smile  
anything  
from, where I'm from

#### Akwaaba

welcome to the land  
of simple dreams  
and wonders kind.

welcome to the home  
of peace, of bliss  
of kings, of queens

#### Ride

jungle style  
bust a whine, for a while  
potential stallion  
give you a ride  
for a mile

a riddle, and a fable  
a truth and a lie  
nothing dark or ugly  
I'll give you smiles  
far enough  
to rival, the Nile

#### Tropical

the way the wind  
does float, does dance  
and sing  
you would think  
it knows true rhythm

but all it does  
is call, and listen

#### Son of the Soil

the man of the moon  
dark and light  
with a soul  
always at noon

he calls the sun  
and runs from none  
he proves the native  
the solemn one

_Thanks for reading. I hope this brought you light and energy._

## Mixed

I know what I feel  
you know that it's real  
unsure? no big deal  
I hurts to still feel

to bend not my ways  
and break not your rays  
I'll walk same as always  
away with dark grace

I will let you go  
so joy you will know  
you need not be sad  
for a while we were glad

---

## Hello

we are strangers  
who know each other  
in our generation  
that's the most normal thing

sing a tune for your soul  
say hello, and some words more  
to the face you used to know  
if you didn't care then  
do not so now

---

## Happy

my joy is not my own  
a heart is not for you  
if you sing to make it sit  
talk to make it thump

my peace is all I own  
gold kisses mean nothing  
those who come close know me  
all else I watch indifferently

---

## Morning, beautiful

I want to say  
a thousand things  
but my mind  
yet still watches  
the dance of your heart

say what you feel  
draw near and breathe deep  
teach me your fantasies  
let me know your faith

and I will conquer a dozen stars  
and take you farther than Mars  
just reach out, speak, smile  
and I will make it worth your while

---

## 10pm

ever came across  
a mirror of your soul  
one that understands  
even when she does not know

a gift, in all she is  
a wind of such calm bliss  
that you write in ink once more  
and dream of digital things
