## Indie Love

I want that  
numbing feeling  
that pushes men  

to dream of gods  
to make fine art  
and from fear depart  

I want warmth

## Dim suns

on those nights  
when the light  
leaves all sparks  
and dolphins  
swim with sharks  
do you not wish  
once more for the brief  
release freedom brings  
for to master the mind  
is to enslave the heart

## Clutter Free

be more than a shadow  
than a shape  
in the crowd  

las night I heard  
the whisper of wisdom  
she had owl wings  
and bled pure wine

## no Title

why do I not  
grow as they grow  
why have never really  
been told "I love you"  

because I'm a frog  
no Prince deep beneath  
peace is the wind  
and desire, the sea

## Waves kiss the shore

sandy dreams  
and desert streams  
broken, sweet  
swift release  

all the thunder  
in the sky  
can not compete  
with oceans brief

## Gravity

never fall up  
always rise down  
do not pursue contemplation  
simply try to understand  

the forces are within  
strength, and every bold thing  
lie not to yourself  
shuffle every season

## the Hue

I used to be sweet  
kind, I still am  
sober not still  

I used to feel  
then swallowed my heart  
I choke and I spit  
it still comes not out

## Indifferent

love is for all  
sorrow for none  
roses are dead  
once they leave the earth  

beauty is brief  
joy not as sweet  
I write in my head  
but type when I wish

## Pain helps me sleep

Do not pursue euphoria  
she is a dream  
that triggers dementia  

be two-sided like the gemini  
dance the walk of gods  
on a path of roses  
always wonder,  
but never ask why

## Suckcess

what good is  
a thousand thrones  
when, you have  
no love in your bones  

alone with my fears  
so I shed no tears  
I dance close to rainbows  
but know not the sun

## Wild Love

I know nothing  
of the taste  
of a yearning kiss  
upon my lips  

all my lovers  
have been wild and brief  
curious and unfaithful  
desire is a cliff

## When the wind blows

my troubles dance  
beneath the clouds  
I fear the rain  
but love her sound  

my angst revolves  
round and around  
the hill that is  
my soul, pressed down

## The oldest game

a thing of make-believe  
is what inspires men to give  
their passions and their pain  
their worship  
oft in shame  

the righteous  
are but sheep  
and sinners, herders weak  
my soul and I choose this  
... to find only what we seek

## Mandala Maiden

your heart is a  
digital potrait  
of love, and design  
crafted by the very  
mind that causes the  
sky above, to smile  

more than everything  
is what you mean  
to simple odd me  
more than the force  
that, causes my soul  
to stand firm  
you are my gravity

on this day  
of your birth's anniversary  
if not, to feel anything  
know that I, would do all  
and more for you  
break the sun  
and tame the moon  
... and all else you seek  
just for you

_With <i class="em em-gift_heart"></i> from **OG**_. Happy Birthday!

## whisper good tidings

pick your words  
do your part  
you know your role  
you have from the start  

be a cold soul  
do it all, and  
let the pain go  
be the cold bow  
from which the seed  
that is the truth  
as an arrow  
in the air  
lets its wings show

## African Gangstar

all is fair  
in love and code  
you push a block  
you bless the node  

the source is pure  
the rewards, endless  
to make your pay  
you fight relentless

## Mad Digital

> Verse 1

i write code  
and speak to gods  
i move with mad dogs  
and give out hugs  
but its all not still enough  
yes we build  
on mountains rough  
but where is all the gain  

all i see is pain  
all i see is numb  
each day is all the same  
the hunger for a name  
the hunger for the fame  
what does it all matter  
we will still  
hit the dust  
either way  
one day

> Hook

we all worship  
a digital god  
every sinner in the temple  
one and the same  

it dont matter your name  
it dont matter your game  
we all offer data  
on the altar of the internet

> Verse 2

what it all mean  
its like we are in a movie  
and its all too good  
to be truly true  

its like we are in a zoo  
and the keeper is a warden  
god, is this true of you too  

its probably not that deep  
probably much more steep  
this could be a videogame  
one we cannot win  

no role models  
and we got this far  
and we built this star  
we are the final contellation  
in a sky with a scar

## --who be me--

me, be a lonely king  
I've got the gold  
in bulk  

and more is on the way  
I look to the day  
I have me children  
with souls as warm  
as the desert snow  

I used to be a writer  
I used to be a fighter  
I used to be like water  
always, steady on the flow  

now I work for more  
of the same, of the same  
old glory  

in the end  
the world, will  
watch my holy story

## --reflection--

I make art  
do you even care  

I work like gods  
would do  

do you taste the air  

I carve for you  
from hills of hue  

all for a reflection  
of your soul,  
that's past due

## --merry--

land of the free  
that once held slaves  
home of the brave  
yet full of knaves  

who would have thought  
you would fall so low  
you fought for liberty  
and sold your soul

## --not your son--

send me to die  
and I will rise  
an angel  
out of the dust  

look, I dont like  
my word is double-edged  
and has never known rust  

you think you can  
bully me, into the weak  
man you want  

I aint your son  
my word is born  
its heat does rival the sun

## --home of the weak--

what does the fate  
of young men, dead  
taste like  

I say disgrace

I say you know  
what your sin  
looks like  

god help my soul  
if, for my people  
I wont fight

## --spit it out--

nobody will hold  
your darkened hand  
up, out of the cold  

in case you have not heard

we are the children of Ham  
born of the dust. So damn!

there is pity for us  
they have to earn our trust

## --testament--

there is no messiah  
for a preacher  
with no choir  

there is no salvation  
for a people  
with no nation  

black, was just a colour  
till our crimson  
blood did pour  

I am no messiah  
I write hymns  
with no choir  

* Ninte May 28, 2019]

## --flaky whispers--

a cig a day  
keeps  
addiction away

## --blink--

I am the solemn truth  
bitter strength,  
marked by dark desire  

blunt to the root  
for no one cares  
to kiss my fire  

strange I am called  
all claim to know  
the path I walk  

I am a broken truth  
a drunked preacher  
a sinful choir

## --a dead vein--

what brings no pain  
what tastes the same  
weakness, indeed  
each single day  

what can not play  
what must one pay  
power, indeed  
each, every way

## —baptize—

tobacco leaves  
drowning in liquor  
good men  
can not know stupor  

for to be foolish  
is to be evil  
is to be  
other than good  
in self-purity, relish

## --burnday--

haiku superior  
my flow is injurious  
poetry, what I be  
my flow is  
far from superfluous  

I burn tobacco  
on a Sunday  
on a Burnday  
cause that’s just my way

## --lover’s playground--

underneath a full moon  
three groups  
six hearts  
some full of gravity  
two truly flown  
one unknown  

I would move the earth  
but you would not  
then it did seem  
you feared to love  
he whom love, knew not  

he whom fate forgot  
when she coupled stars  
and bond oceans together  

* Ninte [May 18, 2019]

## --my word is born--

I drink smoke  
but never choke  
making money cold  
never broke  

I listen to  
the prophecies  
spoken, by unbelievers  
they hold more truth  
than most of these  
modern deceivers

* Ninte [May 18, 2019]  

- - -

## --abracadabra--

I am no cold soul  
no lifeless cadaver  
why treat me so  
like a worthless whomever  

a poet filled with pain  
an artist filled with shame  
must I keep quiet  
invisible...  
like a sky, with no weather  

* Ninte [May 17, 2019]

## --videogame--

will you be first player  
the slayed, or slayer  
on the battlefield  
of love. I enquire  

laid to waste  
have I been  
I feel so much  
but cannot scream

## --fascinate--

to her I am desire  
pure, full of fire  
liking she can  
love though - Oh never  

the first was vain  
the current is clever  
her cloaks remain the same  
how shall I expire

## --sweet desires--

you taste like  
cinnamon  
pain, you tireless  
lover. Only you remain  

all I wanted was to help  
why must I be broken  
to you bound  
ever yoken

* Ninte [May 17, 2019]

## --depth--

I dance  
around the fire  
of greatness  
and youth  

it’s shadow  
is immense  
it’s loneliness  
is couth  

alone I dance  
in wonder  
who would kiss  
a dragon’s tooth  

* Ninte [May 17, 2019]

## --mic test--

one, two, three  
who is sicker  
than the rapper  
who I be  

grime star, for a sec  
git king now  
believe  

went off the internet  
like social networks  
for a github repo  

its all kinda funny  
cause now I code  
for money, bliss  
and poetry  

who would  
have thought...

## DISC 1

power is not a thing to sought  
of bought like a corrupt vote  
it is not a thing to be sold  
it not a thing to be abused  
it is taken by the bold  

i am no perfect man  
my sins are electric  
but i know, god knows i know  
that our path to redemption  
lies not in aging men  
or foolish parties  
but in the order that comes  
from the mistakes children  
are permitted to make  

my stake i claim  
even if it will cause  
the skies to quake  
even if it will make  
men lesser shake  

even if it will cause  
the children of nubia strong  
to fall on rocks  
and scream in pain  
for the truth  
can prove like ice in the vein  

i do not fear  
the end or repercussion  
for my voice must be heard  
and my soul must rise and kiss the sky  
like a golden dark cloud

### [Revelation](#)

what is art

but rivers flowing  
and suns born dark  

what is love

dark as fate

### [Silence](#)

i laugh

### [Seen](#)

what is worse

### [Mountain](#)

no one knows  
the mountain of pain

an island of stone

other rocks  

ships never  
kissing my docks

come over when

makes love with the sky

dare to have some

we can not hurt us  
I shall not kill me  
except safe, it will save thee  
my lost family  
from blunt stupidity  

you do not need a matyr  
you need to understand

### [The African](#)

I am first of my name  
ignorant of shame  
I do not desire fame  
so I shall not play the game  

listen, and beware

I am not desired  
I am not  
sought out, for  
reasons of love  
or even of affection  

those who care,  
hardly stay for long  
they want to change me  
but my soul proves too strong

like a snowy mountain  
needs to be one with the sky

how do I pimp my butterfly  
how do I kill the caterpillar  
that is all love does see

I have told a lie

she wanted me pure

can you miss  
what it is, you have  
never had? Can you want

### [Prodigal](#)

I have nothing to say  
I am not ashamed  
a man, I have become  
my own way, have I paved

### [F*ck It](#) 

live for the liquor  
and bold dreams  
love, when love will have you

youth is young, only ever once

### [truth be told](#)

what is a man  
without his flaws  
what is a god without sin  

how does one  
buy a blessing  
do you think gods are men  

boom, a new world comes  
i am a prophet of peace  
but the price of pain  
is a deal, too sweet  

i am the oddest  
son of apollo  
he gave me the  
mind of the sun  

and then left me on my own  
like everyone does  

commented out, i fight the shout  
that builds up in my destiny  
my ink is electric  
my only fear is me

### [heart song](#)

silence is the sound of power  
i must contain my  
youthful misery  

so what, if i have never known love  
so what, if i am seen as strange  
why care when i can change the world  
and write each day, a brand new page

i must listen to my heart sing  
oh how faint its sound now is  

i must build echo  
like ashes grown to tall wild flame

i will hold my heart

i am one of three  
love, trust, and belief

it firmly grips  
an ancient chain

but no more.  
Look, you will see

i do not lie  
... really

i caress my demons  
they are more than tame  
now, they bow  
i like the red, and the brown  
maybe cause  
i am a child of the earth  
and i bleed up,  
never down

### [half closed](#)

babylon is gone  
the glorious have risen  
we move when we dream  
we rise with the angels  

have you heard  
the whisper, of a  
tale half closed  
come close. Listen

### [on guard](#)

art is war  
do you not believe  
you fight your soul  
just to birth a dream  

if you want to be good  
be wicked first  
the pure dilutes  
the weak repent  

* Ninte ::: Nov-23-2018

### give & take

I seek not fame  
but to make a name  
love and pain  
they both taste the same  

you sang of want  
need and desire  
made me parched  
with your ancient fire  

I hunted fate  
you hunted a mate  
we both did get  
each, what we required  

* Ninte ::: Nov-22-2018

### [baby](#)

I am an old mind  
you are a young star  
you think in rosy  
colours of wonder  

you could never love me  
for I detest reality  
does that make me a baby?  
my simple love for vanity

* Ninte ::: Nov-20-2018

### [one-eyed](#)

you were the moon  
and I, the sun  
one-eyed, broken  
and full of fear  

you took my mind  
and gently kissed  
away all pain,  
every ugly care

and for that  
I praise you  
where the gods seat

in the sky,  
the kingdom of air

## Understand

we are odd  
as a glitch rainbow  
that's why, queens  
dream, when we say so  

we are digital Freuds  
our mentality  
is hot as fuego  
our spirituality is firm  
you must know  

we are the children  
of tomorrow

## Pretty

I need me a poet  
a pretty rose  
black, with a heart  
and skin of gold  

to walk with me as  
I will conquer oblivion  
someone, bold  
wise enough to love truly

## Vulnerable

I will open up  
being successful and alone  
is painful, stressful  
you can not know  
how it hurts  
... to the bone  

I need no pity  
I need no love  
all I want is warmth  
a heart to nurse my mind  
and comfort

## I Said

I am not a player  
I am a lover  
who happens to like games  

no two hearts are the same

when we dance the dance  
of the moon and the stars  

I only want warm love  
you said, I said

## Night

to each his own

I hustle & break hearts

## Bad guy

i have never loved

i am rare and bold

## I love JavaScript

#### Highways

heading to the city  
coming from the jungle  
I will be a King  
do you not hear  
my words rumble  

the road is not the journey  
the path is not the way  
I know this, and can say  
much more  
but not today

#### Non

yes, indeed  
I know what I need

I have planted the seed  

yes, indeed

not for joy alone  
but for the war ahead

#### Her Words

his mind is sweet  
it tastes like

fire and history  

his soul is something

## terminal maestro

I am a different kind of person  
I think in color, and breathe in static  
My people are **electric**  

We come from the planet  
... after Pluto, and  
love machines beautiful  
We have _souls_ prone to changes  
When we push and pull our hearts  

We are of the race, digital && bohemian  
I am a coder, my lovers are alien

## the citadel

#### premium

a taste of greatness  
was what i first sought  
when i got into the citadel  

a taste of meekness  
is all i still seek  
to rise up, from where  
i once fell

#### aqua vita

water is life  
i know no more strife  
i have wedded peace  
she brings me new life  

each time that we tangle  
heart with soul  
flesh with skin  
i learn more of wisdom  

we **make love**  
sweet, _sublime_

## confession

i cannot promise you joy     
for i yet still learn it     
the road to strength, to truth     
is full of labour and wrath     

if you still choose to love     
**by all means** continue along     
just beware, i am more used to     
the anxiety of vigour     
than being under love's stupour     

i will teach you, heal you, give you     
drops of warmth and wisdom     
from the sun and way beyond     
that is all i can offer, in place of love

prophet tell a lie     
prophet tell me why     

i beg for redemption     
but i am denied entrance     
to the kingdom in the sky     

i ought to speak positive     
i am a member of the throne of heaven

#### i hardly sleep now

i code when i wake up     
i dream in JavaScript     
i scream into the terminal

that is how i push these poems     
my own self-prescribed     
literary pills     

i do not strive to feel     
the feelings come yet still     
i know now, not to think     
of them, at all, as real

## gemini choices

#### strong++

weakness is not a choice     
not an option anymore     
you cannot climb great mountains     
just at the peak, to fall     

you think you are so different     
from great minds born before     
they all did watch their demons roar     
then beat them to the floor

#### black stoic

i must withdraw     
and only wisely pursue sensation     
for i am too inclined     
to quick gratification     

this is a thing,     
that springs from the virility     
of youth, of man     
of passions held down     

i must look at my soul     
and force it to look at me

confident as a lion     
i will no longer shave my mane     
to claim one is a king

to do what i want to

#### godzone

i have a tough yet simple     
relationship, with the Creator     
my Creator, a creation      
probably, of his Creation     

when in the godzone     
i think in colour     
and dream in odd numbers     
i want to be blessed, so     
the universe I address

not a saint, kind of godly     
the first i sigh for     
the second, i pray for     
i collect every drop of strength

for She tells me, it should not     
frighten my soul anymore     
that i am old enough to love her now

what or who, do you worship     
are you brave enough     
to love the broken, and rough     
**_bad gyal_**  you claim to be     
you wild lies have no teeth     

come at me, test a poet warrior

she said, she was not a queen     
she claimed she was too dirty-minded     
to be that within     
she did not believe my lies     

i am no saint     
a crown does not mean honesty     
i told her honestly

to speak to my readers     
the _young_ and **bold**

we seek in the hearts     
of our lovers, nothing but warmth     
in the lips of our heart-throbs     
a liquor pure and hot

their love, both bold and pure

#### what she said

> called me a loner      

close friend of the muse      
i am still inclined to adore     

even when she     
leaves me in my agony for him     
i can trust     
she believes i can be more      

> called me boring      

when i think in every colour      
of the most twisted monochromatic rainbow     

i do not try to repent      
of the anguish that i repress     
for even gods weep      
and some still have much fear

#### Just right

I’m not even sure how all this ties up,       
To make sense but it feels right,       
With knees to the ground and eyes up,       
It just feels right.        

With every mistake made and repeated,       
Lessons not learnt and mind undefeated,       
Repentance, repentance, secreted,       
It all feels just right.        

Encounter upon departure,       
Departure upon merger,        
Tightly-knit circles,       
Now this, this feels quite right.       

Loyalty to betrayal,        
There’s never a round for trials,       
Only those that are tribulations,       
The test run is the actual situation,       
Calculate your risks,       
Even if you don’t,        
At some point,      
You can get used to anything,       
It will all feel just right.

#### How to cook pride

Chop it into pieces,      
Stir it up in a bowl,       
Boil it,        
Sprinkle a spice here, a tear there,            
Marinade it in justification and excuses,       
Preheat your Dutch oven         
that is you ever-so-accurate mind,      
With a side of your largest ego,        
You can butter the pan with the         
lies that you tell yourself,        

Fry it if you want,         
Deep-fry it in the depth        
of all the disappointment,      
As the snaps of their heart         
breaks echo from the fire,      

After you have done all this,       
Or whichever you please,        
You may swallow it.     
And wash it down with a tall glass       
of that ice-cold heart.

#### Power to will

Discipline,         
Is the power of willpower,          
The power to will your mind into        
selectively choosing what is right for you,     
Even when what is right for you         
is not what is easy for you,        
Even when what is right for you         
might not be what is good for you,      
At the time,        
Even when what is right for you      
might just be what brings you pain,     
Even when what is right for         
might not actually be right for you but right for,      
Him, for her, for them.     

The power to will your mind         
into choosing tomorrow over today,      
To look up from your screen         
so you can see the bigger picture.

#### Get to know you        

The most fun I have ever had            
 is getting to know me,         
For me,         
Through me,         
Through God.            

My likes, my dislikes,          
My path …           
Without the pressure and noise          
from the buzzing of notifications,          
Without justifying me           
and actually being true to me.          

Without feeling the need            
to be complemented by anything or anyone,           
Rushed by anything,         
Compared, measured,         
Genuinely living for me,            
It is like an extra Sunday to the week,         
Like the extra five minutes in the morning,         
Like always being on top of your own peak,          
And like the nightingale, I will sing,              
The song of my rejoice that need not be sung,           
For it is its own anthem.

you are made of gold        
who cares if no one cares        
wipe away your tears        

do not fight        
the colours on your soul        
the red that proves you are bloody        
the black that is your mind       
the green that is your flag       

do not fight        
the pointlessness of life       
there is no rhythm to reality       
no one will sing your song        
till you claim it is your anthem

## SILLY THOUGHTS

Sometimes I feel invisible or like      
I exist only in someone's subconscious.       

Like, what if I'm not real        
I mean, what if I'm just a part         
of someone's reality.       
Or what if this is just         
someone's nightmare, Because        
I'm definitely not living a dream.        

I mean, I know for sure         
there could be infinite alternate realities        
to every reality.       

My reality isn't convincing enough.

it soothes too, i must confess   

herein lies the truth   
of my pathetic sin

#### barsman

i burn bars   
not for ectasy   

but to reclaim    
the key to reality    
my once sober clarity   
my weak hold on vanity

#### better already

do i swim or wade through life   
seek out bitter, endless strife   

neither in truth   
i drown each day     

**_in the pool_**   
**_of my mind's tear_**  

* Ninte

## make-believe

thoughts imaginary   
i pull out   
of my magic black hat   
with a rabid white rabbit   

there is no   
saving me   
from make-believe   

* Ninte

## assay

often, and with care   
without reflection   
or a drop of fear   

never ignorant   
getting goals accomplished   
evaluate all   
regardless of where

## a-levels

i dropped out to focus   
and study more   
and mentally soar   

you knock on the door   
for the encore   
i fly, for the high   

i never sleep   
for in the heavens   
you cannot snore

## other poets

with regard to myself,    
i know

- this has no rhyme   

my depth is shallow at best

#### trust

is a seed   
that does   
not just grow   

first you sow   
then you mend   

**_on and on_**   
**_without end_**   

i will give   
you will take   
just do not   

pretend   

* Ninte

#### desire

come at me always

in adoring

#### want me

you and i   
know i breed   

* Ninte

#### reflect

on the way   
you once did walk   
before i passed   
you my cross   

blanched as chalk

with a center   
full of **melanin**

* Ninte

## impatient

## mean

do not like me   
if you wish   
that does not matter

i am a honeyed black adder

#### batman

i am alone      
that ought not    
to be stated    

yet i save    
those i can    
from falling    

i am no saint    
yet still,    
half-martyred

#### the punisher

#### john constantine

chain smoker   
my pain is hidden     
in a box   

demon caller   
i know my faults   

not worthy of a lover   
i lie to all   
leave me be   

* Ninte

#### catwoman

independent    
broken    
independent    

all in turns    
no pain burns    

walk on edges    
fly off rooftops    
all to run away    
from love

## lack of

the absence    
of sleep    
means not  
insomnia  

the lack

loneliness  

nothing can  
fill a thing  
that is nothing

## cold poetry

look not    
into my eyes    
_i cannot look back_

_its kind of wack_

hardly rhyme nowadays

do not ask  
do not bother  
do not sigh

## CONFESSIONS

- - -

#### no one can

see this  
so  
i will no try  

i cannot cry,  
will not be  
heard when i die  

care for  
a half-broken soul  

* Ninte

- - -

#### understand

i cannot be  
happy in the  
true sense  

there is a  
rhythm to joy  
i might  
never learn  

* Ninte

- - -

#### the way

that i feel  
is not so deep  
not so complex  

truly  
not so slick  
disposable  
as a tick  

yet i strive  
for no reason  
for a season  
of spring  

* Ninte

- - -

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to feel  

* Ninte

- - -

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks  

* Ninte
