## Mixed

I know what I feel  
you know that it's real  
unsure? no big deal  
I hurts to still feel

to bend not my ways  
and break not your rays  
I'll walk same as always  
away with dark grace

I will let you go  
so joy you will know  
you need not be sad  
for a while we were glad

## Hello

we are strangers  
who know each other  
in our generation  
that's the most normal thing

sing a tune for your soul  
say hello, and some words more  
to the face you used to know  
if you didn't care then  
do not so now

## Happy

my joy is not my own  
a heart is not for you  
if you sing to make it sit  
talk to make it thump

my peace is all I own  
gold kisses mean nothing  
those who come close know me  
all else I watch indifferently

## Morning, beautiful

I want to say  
a thousand things  
but my mind  
yet still watches  
the dance of your heart

say what you feel  
draw near and breathe deep  
teach me your fantasies  
let me know your faith

and I will conquer a dozen stars  
and take you farther than Mars  
just reach out, speak, smile  
and I will make it worth your while

## 10pm

ever came across  
a mirror of your soul  
one that understands  
even when she does not know

a gift, in all she is  
a wind of such calm bliss  
that you write in ink once more  
and dream of digital things
