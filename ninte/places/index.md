## Monday in Lagos

I woke up to religion  
I went to work  
with strong precision  
To move ahead, yet still

The peaceful get nothing  
in the temple of the Lagoon  
My mother's people  
The meek and the mild  
They hustle to fill their spoon

## Letters from Accra

> A short collection of poems written during the Chale Wote festivities in Accra (Ghana), 2019

#### Origins

I do not know where  
I truly do come from  
my soul does  
beat, and hiss, and hum

my heart  
proves a crooked drum  
I seek no validation

nor look to beg, "please"  
my nation is a country  
that knows not that it is

#### Anything

rainbows from the sun  
love that's always born  
a sacred need  
true wonder indeed

anything  
can make you smile  
anything  
from, where I'm from

#### Akwaaba

welcome to the land  
of simple dreams  
and wonders kind.

welcome to the home  
of peace, of bliss  
of kings, of queens

#### Ride

jungle style  
bust a whine, for a while  
potential stallion  
give you a ride  
for a mile

a riddle, and a fable  
a truth and a lie  
nothing dark or ugly  
I'll give you smiles  
far enough  
to rival, the Nile

#### Tropical

the way the wind  
does float, does dance  
and sing  
you would think  
it knows true rhythm

but all it does  
is call, and listen

#### Son of the Soil

the man of the moon  
dark and light  
with a soul  
always at noon

he calls the sun  
and runs from none  
he proves the native  
the solemn one
