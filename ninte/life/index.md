## At an end

fight the void  
or fight the noise  
either way, it is your choice

the darkness  
is the light  
the bright star  
shines not at night

ask why  
of yourself, and I  
will appear and  
teach you of  
ancient philosophies

pause here,  
make no love to hypocrisies

---

## Lucid

clear are my thoughts  
after wars won, and love lost  
succeed we must  
as long as air kisses the dust

my art will grow  
joy you will know  
for we are the light  
of an ancient sun

strong we shall be  
this be our destiny

---

## Hook

do not believe I  
know not what I  
desire, seek, require, believe

just because  
sometimes I fall shy  
of your simple imaginations

---

## Reality

we dance away from  
stronger roots, than  
branches stretched from  
the mind's roof.

for sake of pain, for  
same again, and stumble  
sharp, with crooked hooves.  
when we could stand

indeed we do, we wake up strong  
from dreams untrue.  
with hope quite calm  
and vigor renewed,

to do the things  
we feared to do.

## The Journey

The Journey
Once upon a time  
A little while ago  
My younger self  
Hopped on a jet  
To learn to scale technology.

I left the land  
I knew as home  
All for faith,  
To grow some more  
To rise & soar.

The journey has begun  
For a life of Entrepreneurship  
Never truly ends.  
Blessed with momentum infinite  
I have newfound family.
