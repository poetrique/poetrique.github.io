## Alone

look at the title  
I am not so  
speak and breathe with apostles  
dance around thoughts colossal

I am a child of God so  
I fall, I weep, I think  
to live, is not to be good or bad, so  
I learn my ways  
each passing day

## Seasons

man has been falling  
ever since before  
his tongue, learned to turn  
and kiss flame  
learned to burn

you should follow no format  
be free, and come close  
live with your soul above the sky  
let the dust know naught of your toes  
man has been rising

## Initialize

you know what to do  
the boxes are made  
tick, check  
draw the line across

you know what to do  
at this time  
the light of the moon  
should cut you no more

## Beginnings

even as I waver  
I know some things to be true  
the rising of the sun, after night  
and the face of the ocean, blue

## A Poem At Dusk

at seventeen  
all I wanted to do was dream  
and I did, till I fell asleep  
when I woke  
I feared to breathe, to blink  
and then I slept once more  
and in a dream I witnessed  
a vague relevation  
this, triggered a hunt  
for what I knew not  
a hunger did whirl  
in my youthful soul

a week to nineteen  
I met with reality  
she sang me a song  
of digital vitality.  
one of wonder, one of strength  
and I learnt to sculpt the shadows of the web  
I learnt to give form, to thoughts  
a blessed gift, indeed that is  
for one who was at then  
as truly lost as I was

fast forwardâ€¦ twenty-one  
in a land of warmth, serene  
I know now  
even though the road, was in itself  
nothing odd, the destination is yet still  
so intense that all can do is tutor my mind  
walk in awe and nod  
as the path grows ever narrow  
and I grow ever thirsty  
for the precious drops of nectar  
that wisdom offers her travellers

to dream should never seem  
truly like anything, too foolish to pursue  
too stressful to endure  
if I have learnt nothing  
I have learnt to trust  
in the motions of universal winds  
for all things  
come to those who work  
even more so, than those who walk  
for in the path itself, is nothing but a way  
in the light of night  
may I still trek the same
